<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Fueling Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Fueling Station</li><li>LNG Fueling Station</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The natural gas fueling station market is divided into two types: CNG (compressed natural gas) fueling stations and LNG (liquefied natural gas) fueling stations. CNG fueling stations compress natural gas to high pressures, allowing vehicles to refill their tanks quickly. LNG fueling stations, on the other hand, cool natural gas to extremely low temperatures, turning it into a liquid form for easier transportation and storage. Both types of stations offer convenient and efficient fueling options for vehicles powered by natural gas.</p></p>
