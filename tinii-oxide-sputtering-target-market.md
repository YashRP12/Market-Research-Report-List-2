<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tin(II) Oxide Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotatable Transformation</li><li>Non Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tin(II) oxide sputtering target market is categorized into two types: rotatable transformation and non-rotating type. In the rotatable transformation market, the target can rotate during the sputtering process, which helps to ensure a more uniform deposition of the tin(II) oxide film on the substrate. On the other hand, the non-rotating type market involves targets that do not rotate during sputtering, but still deliver high-quality deposition with consistent thickness and composition. These two types cater to different sputtering requirements and offer options based on specific application needs.</p></p>
