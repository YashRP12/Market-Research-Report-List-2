<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aerostatic Bearings</li><li>Aerodynamic Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air bearings are a type of bearing that use a thin film of air to support the load and provide frictionless movement. There are two main types of air bearings: aerostatic bearings and aerodynamic bearings. Aerostatic bearings use a pressurized air film to create the cushioning effect, allowing for ultra-precise movements. On the other hand, aerodynamic bearings use a self-generated air film by rotating the bearing elements, enabling high-speed rotation with minimal friction. Both types find applications in various industries, including precision manufacturing, aerospace, and scientific research.</p></p>
