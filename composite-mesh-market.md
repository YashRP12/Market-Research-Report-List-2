<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-absorbable Mesh</li><li>Absorbable Mesh</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite mesh is a type of mesh used in surgical procedures to provide support and reinforcement to weak or damaged tissue. It is made up of different materials that offer specific benefits. Non-absorbable mesh is designed to remain in the body permanently, providing long-term support. Absorbable mesh, on the other hand, is designed to gradually dissolve over time as the tissue regenerates. Other types of composite mesh include those that combine absorbable and non-absorbable materials, allowing for both short-term support and long-term reinforcement. These variations offer surgeons options based on the patient's specific needs.</p></p>
