<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Cooling Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Cooling</li><li>Indirect Cooling</li><li>Two Stage Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Evaporative cooling towers are used in various industries for temperature control purposes. Direct cooling towers directly expose warm water to the air while evaporation occurs, reducing the water temperature. Indirect cooling towers use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the warm water to a separate cooling medium, which then evaporates. Two-stage cooling towers have two sections, with the first stage using direct cooling and the second stage employing indirect cooling. This combination allows for a greater reduction in water temperature and provides more efficient cooling.</p></p>
