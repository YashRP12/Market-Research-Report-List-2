<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Descaler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitive</li><li>Non-capacitive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electronic descaler market is categorized into two types: capacitive and non-capacitive. Capacitive electronic descalers use capacitors to alter the electrical charge of the water, preventing the formation of limescale in pipes and appliances. Non-capacitive electronic descalers, on the other hand, use electromagnetic waves to modify the crystal structure of minerals in the water, inhibiting limescale buildup. Both types provide alternative solutions to traditional water softeners by addressing the issues caused by hard water without the need for chemicals or salt.</p></p>
