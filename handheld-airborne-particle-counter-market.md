<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Airborne Particle Counter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionising</li><li>Non-ionising</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The handheld airborne particle counter market can be classified into two types: ionising and non-ionising. Ionising particle counters use radiation to ionise particles, which then allows for their detection. This type of counter is more suitable for detecting larger particles and can be used in environments where higher precision is not required. On the other hand, non-ionising particle counters use laser technology to detect particles. These counters are more commonly used for detecting smaller particles and provide higher precision measurements. Both types offer different capabilities and are employed based on specific requirements.</p></p>
