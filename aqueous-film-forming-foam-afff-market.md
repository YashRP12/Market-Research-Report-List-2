<p><h1>Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Market Size, Growth and Forecast from 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) is a type of firefighting foam that is commonly used to extinguish flammable liquid fires. It contains a mixture of water, foam concentrate, and additives that create a film, or aqueous film, on the surface of the flammable liquid, preventing oxygen from reaching the fuel and suppressing the fire.</p><p>The AFFF market is expected to experience steady growth in the coming years. This can be attributed to several factors, including increasing awareness about fire safety and the need for effective firefighting agents. Additionally, the rising incidence of industrial accidents and fires, particularly in sectors such as oil and gas, manufacturing, and chemical industries, is driving the demand for AFFF.</p><p>Furthermore, the development of advanced formulations of AFFF that are more effective in suppressing various types of flammable liquid fires is also expected to propel market growth. Manufacturers are investing in research and development activities to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of AFFF products.</p><p>However, the AFFF market also faces challenges such as the growing concerns over the environmental impact of firefighting foam. AFFF contains per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that have been found to be harmful to human health and the environment. This has led to regulatory restrictions and bans on certain types of AFFF in several countries. To overcome these challenges, manufacturers are focusing on developing PFAS-free alternatives.</p><p>Overall, despite the challenges, the AFFF market is expected to grow at a moderate rate of 4.9% CAGR during the forecasted period, driven by increasing fire safety awareness, industrial accidents, and ongoing research and development efforts to improve AFFF formulations.</p></p>
