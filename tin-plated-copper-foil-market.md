<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tin Plated Copper Foil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Copper Foil</li><li>Electrolytic Copper Foil</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tin plated copper foil refers to a type of copper foil that has been coated with a layer of tin. There are two main types of tin plated copper foil in the market, namely rolled copper foil and electrolytic copper foil. Rolled copper foil is manufactured by passing the copper through a rolling mill, resulting in a thin and flexible foil. On the other hand, electrolytic copper foil is produced through an electroplating process, where a thin layer of copper is deposited onto a substrate. Both types are widely used in various industries for their conductivity and corrosion resistance.</p></p>
