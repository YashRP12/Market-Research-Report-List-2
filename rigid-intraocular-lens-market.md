<p><h1>Rigid Intraocular Lens Market Size Furnishes Valuable Information Encompassing Market Share, Market Trends, and Projections Spanning from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Rigid Intraocular Lens Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A rigid intraocular lens (IOL) is a type of artificial lens used in cataract surgery to replace the natural lens of the eye. Unlike soft IOLs, rigid IOLs are made from a more rigid material such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or silicone. Rigid IOLs have been traditionally used in cataract surgery due to their durability and stability.</p><p>The market for rigid intraocular lenses is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. Factors contributing to this growth include an increasing number of cataract surgeries worldwide, a growing elderly population, and advancements in surgical techniques. The market is also driven by the rising demand for high-quality, long-lasting IOLs that provide improved visual outcomes for patients.</p><p>In terms of market trends, there has been a shift towards the adoption of foldable IOLs over rigid IOLs in recent years. Foldable IOLs offer advantages such as smaller incision size, easier insertion, and faster recovery times compared to rigid IOLs. However, rigid IOLs still hold a significant market share due to their lower cost, high durability, and compatibility with different surgical techniques.</p><p>The market for rigid intraocular lenses is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.90% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of cataract and age-related eye diseases, along with the growing demand for technologically advanced IOLs. Additionally, the market is likely to benefit from the expanding healthcare infrastructure in developing countries and the introduction of innovative products by key market players.</p></p>
