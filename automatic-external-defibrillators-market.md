<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully Automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) are medical devices used to restore normal heart rhythm in individuals experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. There are two types of AEDs in the market: semi-automated and fully automated. </p><p>Semi-automated AEDs require the user to manually initiate the shock by pressing a button after it analyzes the heart rhythm and determines the need for defibrillation. In contrast, fully automated AEDs do not require any user intervention and deliver the electrical shock automatically if it detects a life-threatening heart rhythm.</p><p>Both types of AEDs aim to provide timely intervention to save lives during cardiac emergencies, but differ in the level of user involvement in initiating the defibrillation process.</p></p>
