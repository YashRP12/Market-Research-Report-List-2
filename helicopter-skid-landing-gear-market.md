<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helicopter Skid Landing Gear Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Skid Gear</li><li>Low Skid Gear</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The helicopter skid landing gear market consists of two primary types: high skid gear and low skid gear. High skid gear refers to landing gear that is designed to keep the helicopter's main body elevated off the ground when it touches down. This type of gear offers increased clearance and maneuverability, making it suitable for operations in uneven or rough terrains. On the other hand, low skid gear allows the helicopter's main body to rest directly on the ground when landing. This type of gear is commonly used in flat and paved landing areas.</p></p>
