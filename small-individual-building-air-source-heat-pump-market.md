<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Individual Building Air Source Heat Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-to-Air</li><li>Air-to-Water</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The small individual building air source heat pump market is divided into two types: air-to-air and air-to-water. In the air-to-air market, heat pumps extract energy from the outside air and distribute it directly into indoor spaces through fans or ducts. This provides both heating and cooling capabilities for the building. On the other hand, air-to-water heat pumps transfer the extracted energy to a water-based distribution system, typically for heating purposes, such as radiators or underfloor heating. These systems do not provide cooling capabilities like air-to-air heat pumps.</p></p>
