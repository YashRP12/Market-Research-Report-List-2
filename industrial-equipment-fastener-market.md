<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Equipment Fastener Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threaded Fasteners</li><li>Non-Threaded Fasteners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial equipment fastener market consists of two main types: threaded fasteners and non-threaded fasteners. Threaded fasteners, such as bolts and screws, have ridges or grooves (threads) that allow them to be screwed into a corresponding hole or nut for secure fastening. Non-threaded fasteners, on the other hand, do not have these threads and are typically used for different purposes like clamping or joining materials together. Both types play crucial roles in various industries, providing reliable connections and fastening solutions for industrial equipment.</p></p>
