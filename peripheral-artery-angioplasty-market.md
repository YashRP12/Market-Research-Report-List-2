<p><strong>The Peripheral Artery Angioplasty Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Angioplasty</li><li>Stent Implantation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral artery angioplasty is a medical procedure used to treat blocked or narrowed blood vessels in the arms, legs, and other peripheral areas of the body. The market for this procedure is divided into two types: balloon angioplasty and stent implantation. Balloon angioplasty involves inserting a deflated balloon into the affected artery and then inflating it to widen the artery and improve blood flow. Stent implantation involves placing a metal mesh tube (stent) inside the artery to hold it open. These procedures are essential to restore blood flow and alleviate symptoms in patients with peripheral artery disease.</p></p>
