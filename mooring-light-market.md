<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mooring Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incandescent</li><li>LED Lights</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The mooring light market consists of two primary types: incandescent lights and LED lights. Incandescent lights use a heated filament to produce light and have been traditionally used in mooring applications. However, LED lights are gaining popularity due to their energy efficiency, longer lifespan, and brighter illumination. LED lights use light-emitting diodes that consume less power and produce less heat. These lights emit a high-intensity beam, ensuring better visibility and safety during mooring operations. Both types are widely available in the market to cater to different customer preferences and requirements.</p></p>
