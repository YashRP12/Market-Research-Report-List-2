<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ground Source Heat Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Exchange (DX)</li><li>Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ground source heat pump (GSHP) market types include direct exchange (DX), closed loop, and open loop systems. A direct exchange GSHP utilizes refrigerant to transfer heat directly between the ground and the heating/cooling system. Closed loop GSHPs use a circulating fluid (usually water or antifreeze solution) to indirectly transfer heat via a closed loop of pipes buried underground. Open loop GSHPs extract water from a well or other water source to transfer heat, and then discharge the water to another well or surface water. These systems provide efficient and sustainable heating and cooling solutions for various applications.</p></p>
