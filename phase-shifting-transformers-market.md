<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phase Shifting Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Core Type</li><li>Two Core Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Phase shifting transformers are used in power systems to adjust the phase angle between two voltages, providing power flow control. There are two main types: single core and two core. In single core transformers, the primary and secondary windings are placed on the same iron core, allowing phase shifting by changing the tap settings on the windings. Two core transformers, on the other hand, consist of two separate transformers connected in series, providing greater flexibility in controlling the phase angle. Both types play a crucial role in adjusting power flow, maintaining system stability, and managing grid efficiency.</p></p>
