<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Power Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double-fed converter</li><li>Full-power converter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wind power converter market consists of two main types: double-fed converter and full-power converter. A double-fed converter is a popular choice due to its cost-efficiency and ability to control generator power. It uses a partially rated converter that manages rotor-side power while grid-side power is controlled by a simple power electronics system. On the other hand, a full-power converter is more advanced and expensive, as it employs a full-capacity converter on both grid and rotor sides, offering precise control over the entire wind turbine system.</p></p>
