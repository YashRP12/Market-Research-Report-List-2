<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NBR Foam Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Cell Rubber</li><li>Semi-closed Cell Rubber</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>NBR foam products are available in two main market types: closed cell rubber and semi-closed cell rubber. Closed cell rubber has tightly packed cells which do not allow air or liquid to penetrate. This makes it highly resistant to moisture, heat, and chemicals, suitable for applications such as insulation, gaskets, and seals. On the other hand, semi-closed cell rubber has partially connected cells that allow some air and liquid passage. This type of foam offers more flexibility and breathability, making it useful for cushioning, packaging, and sound absorption purposes.</p></p>
