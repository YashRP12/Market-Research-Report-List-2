<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Electronic Fan</li><li>Centrifugal Electronic Fan</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electronic fan market is divided into three main types: axial electronic fan, centrifugal electronic fan, and other markets. Axial electronic fans are designed to create a flow of air parallel to the fan's axis, offering high airflow and relatively low pressure. On the other hand, centrifugal electronic fans employ blades that rotate away from the axis, generating high pressures at lower airflow rates. Lastly, the "other market" includes various types of electronic fans that may have unique designs or target specific applications, such as portable fans, ceiling fans, or computer cooling fans.</p></p>
